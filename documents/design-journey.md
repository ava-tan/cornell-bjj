# Project 4 - Design & Plan

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.


# Planning

## Client Description (Milestone 1) - Ava
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?

Our client is the Cornell Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club. They would like a website for outreach to new members and to educate newcomers about what jiu jitsu is. Their key goals are to inform potential new members about the club and to make jiu jitsu more accessible to beginners.

> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the Project 4 requirements.


## Site's Purpose (Milestone 1)
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.

The website's purpose is to educate potential new members about what jiu jitsu is and what the club is. Through the website, the club wants to make jiu jitsu more accessible to a larger audience, especially at Cornell.

## Client Meeting Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from the client meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting.

![Meeting Minutes](meetingminutes1.png)

## Client Needs and Wants (Milestone 1)
> Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.

Needs/Wants:
- **Needs and Wants** [What does your client need and want?]
  - Inform beginners about what jiu jitsu is
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Have a "Jiu Jitsu Basics" page that includes a summary of the sport and reference videos/what gear jiu jitsu entails
- **Memo** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - Having a dedicated page will give newcomers a clear page to visit if they want to learn more about how to get started with the sport

- **Needs and Wants**
  - Calendar to show schedule
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include an interactive calendar that shows the schedule for practices/events
- **Memo**
    - Standalone calendar would make the events/schedule for the club clear and organized, members would be informed about events

- **Needs and Wants**
  - Information about the club, what they are, where they meet, and when
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - On the home page, include images and a summary of what the club is and when/where they meet
- **Memo**
  - Having the most essential information about the club on the home page will make the club more accessible to potential members

- **Needs and Wants**
  - A way for potential members to show interest in the club/sign up for more information
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
  - Include a form to sign up for listserv/show interest in the club
- **Memo**
  - Form can also include skill level

## User(s) (Milestone 1) - Asher
The primary purpose of this website is member recruitment and conversion. That makes the intended audience for this site Cornell students who are not currently in the club, but who have an interest either in jiu-jitsu, more generally martial arts, or simply in finding a new way to stay fit while on campus.

## Discovering Users' Needs (Milestone 1) -Asher
> You'll need to discover your users' needs. Talk to them! Document what you've learned about them. When talking to your users, take notes and include those notes here.

![](kris.jpg)
![](jessie.jpg)

## Users' Needs (Milestone 1) -Asher
> Analyze the users' needs and wants from your notes above. List each need/want below. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.
> **Note:** These are probably *not* the needs of your client.

Need/Want: Where/when
- **Needs and Wants** [What do the users need and want?]
  - Needs to know when the club meets and where
- **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs and wants?]
  - Will have the location and time of club meetings on the home page
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
  - This was a common need, so it makes sense to have the information easily accessible as one of the first things the user sees on the site

Need/Want: jiu-jitsu info
- **Needs and Wants**
    - Information about jiu-jitsu is relatively limited, so they need info about what it is
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - Have a dedicated jiu-jitsu page that includes a summary of what it is and tips about how to get started and improve
- **Rationale**
    - makes sense to have its own page so it doesn't crowd out other content
    - makes the information easily accessible from the nav

Need/Want: Responsiveness
- **Needs/wants**
    - users said they would probably access the website on the phone more than their Desktop
    - needs mobile design to be easy to use
- **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - hamburger navigation so the site's easy to navigate on Mobile
    - all content will scale down to mobile and font size will increase
    - calendar will work on mobile as well
- **rationale**
    - It's easier to check things like times and events on the go using a phone, so this trend makes sense.


## User Testing Plan (Milestone 1) - Jonna
> Plan out your tasks for evaluating whether your site will meet the needs of the users. These must be actual user testing tasks. Tasks are not questions!

You just got to Cornell for your first week of college! Having done jiu jitsu for several years, you really want to get involve in the Cornell jiu jitsu club and happened to stumble across their website.

1. Exploring the site, where and when does jiu jitsu club meet? (You'll be sure to show up!)

2. You want to see a few people on the team before you actually go to practice. Find the team roster and the contact information of four team members.

3. After browsing a bit, you're definitely interested in joining! Sign up for the listserv and find the consent form you need to sign before going to the first meeting.

4. You realize you forgot to bring your jiu jitsu uniform to Ithaca - move-in was too hectic! Find where you can get another jiu jitsu uniform as well as any other equipment you need to join the club.

## Content (Milestone 1) - Jonna
> Plan out your site's content (text, images, etc.). Make a list of **all** the content you will need. This list should be **exhaustive**.

- images
  - club group photo
  - jiu jitsu practice in action
  - jiu jitsu uniform
  - photos/headshots of the officers
  - required items/equipment to get started
- text
  - description of the club
  - where/when the club meets
  - what is jiu jitsu?
  - contact information of officers

    - introductory moves
- forms
  - sign up for listserv
  - consent form (PDF)
- calendar of jiu jitsu practices/events


 of the team
- description of the club
- where/when the club meets

## Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 1) - Leo
> Come up with some idea for interactive features for your site.

- the form will be able to be filled out by the user
- image gallery will be able to be scrolled through by the user
- being able to navigate through the calendar.


# Design & Evaluation

## Design Process (Milestone 1)
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Design your navigation from the card sorting. Outline your navigation. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc.
> You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

> **Note:** Card sorting is used to organize your site's content. For each piece of content identified in the previous section, write a summary of that content onto a card. Now sort the cards. The grouping of cards provides you with your pages for your website. **Do not write down the pages you want and then "card sort" those. That is not card sorting.**

* Card sorting
    * Card Sort A:
        * Like how sign up is on first page grouped with about the club
        * What is jiu jitsu page, not sure about the videos + consent form grouping
    ![Card Sort A](cardsortA.jpg)
    * Card Sort B:
        * Fourth group: everything you need to join the club
        * Link between videos + outfitters?
    ![Card Sort B](card_sort_b.JPG)
    * Card Sort C:
        * Calendar should be own page, what is the link between where/when + sign up for listserv
        * images of team should be more central
        * like about the club and what is jiu jitsu
    ![Card Sort C](cardsortc.jpeg)
    * Card Sort D:
        * like the what is jiu jitsu grouping
        * contact info should go with team officers
        * like sign up and link together
    ![Card Sort D](cardsortD.jpg)
    * Final Card Sort:

## Interactivity (Milestone 1) - Leo
Navigation bar, calendar, consent form, and image gallery. All this meets the needs of our client because the calendar will show what days the jiujitsu club will meet, the navigation bar will make it easier for them to navigate and find the necessary information that they are looking for, the image gallery will provide them a visual of what the club is like, and the consent form will let them fill out the agreement to join the club.

## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Write your interactivity pseudocode here.

Calendar pseudocode:

    How the data is stored:
        ```
            1. create a list of all months the web owner has events for
            2. Link each month to the number of days in that month
            3. Link each month to a list of days in that month
            4. Link each day to a nested list containing one list of times and one list of events.
        ```

    How the data is displayed:
        ```
            1. Use javascript to get the current month
            2. Find that month in the list
            3. Use js to find the first day of that month
            4. Starting from that day, add the date to each box on the calendar
            5. Add the name of the month to the title of the calendar header

            When a day is clicked:
                1. Find the relevant day's time and events
                2. Add to the pop up's time field the list of Times
                3. add to the event field the list of events
                4. set the pop up display to fixed.
                5. Set the pop up title to the date

            When the close button is clicked:
                1. set the pop_up display to none
        ```

Example:
```
when DOM is loaded:

  if today is a monday:
    show Monday's soup and Monday's daily special

```
Sign Up Form:
```
When the user tries to submit the form:  
    If the name HTML5 validation criteria has not been met:  
        Show the feedback message, "Must enter a valid name."  
        Do not submit the form.  
    If the email HTML5 validation criteria has not been met:  
        Show the feedback message, "Must enter a valid email address."  
        Do not submit the form.   
    If the interest textbox HTML5 validation criteria has not been met:
        Show the feedback message, "Please input a response that is between 10 to 500 characters in length."
    Otherwise,  
        Show no feedback message.  
        Submit the form to the server.
```
